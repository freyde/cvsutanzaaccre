Since then, several transformations in the name of                        the school took place such as Indang Farm School in 1918, Indang Rural High School                        in 1927, and Don Severino National Agriculture School in 1958. In 1964, the school                        was converted into a State College by virtue of Republic Act 3917 and became known                        as Don Severino Agricultural College (DSAC). DSAC lived by its mission of providing                        quality  and  affordable  education  to  the  economically  disadvantaged  (cvsu.edu.ph,                        2017).                                On January 22, 1998, by virtue of Republic Act No.8468, DSAC was converted                        into Cavite State University.
