                       Section 1.  Preparation of Research Proposal

                                     The  making  of  the  research  and  development  plans  starts  when  the
                              Director  of  Research  calls  for  an  annual  research  proposal  review.    Interested
                              faculty researchers create capsule proposals in line with the University’s current
                              research thrust/s and other fields of interest.  Faculty researchers having the same
                              field of interest may form a research program consisting of various projects and
                              studies.  Otherwise, a researcher may prepare his/her own project/study proposal
                              in accordance with the University’s current thrust or with their respective fields of
                              interest.    The  proponent  submits  the  capsule  research  proposal  thru  proper
                              endorsement to the Research Director.  Appendix 1 shows the sample of standard
                              research proposal format used by all researchers for external funding.


                       Section 2.  Evaluation of Research Proposal

                                     The  submitted  capsule  research  proposals  will  be  presented  by  the
                              researcher in a Technical Review of Proposal (TRP) attended by the University
                              Research  and  Extension  Council  (URDE  serving  as  panel  of  evaluators.  The
                              Council is chaired by the Vice President for Research and Extension and co-chaired
                              by the Director for Research.


                                     Once  the  proposals  are  presented,  the  committee  reviews  the  title,
                              rationale, objectives, expected output, methodology, and budget of the research
                              proposals.  The evaluators must provide relevant comments and suggestions on
                              how to further  improve  the  contents  of  the  proposals.   Appendix  2  shows  the
                              Research Proposal Evaluation Sheet Form 1.


                                     The criteria for the evaluation of the research proposal shall be based on
                              the following:

                                         ▪   clarity of the rationale
                                         ▪   rationality and attainability of set objectives
                                         ▪   appropriateness of the methodology
                                         ▪   feasibility in terms of time
                                         ▪   area requirement and cost
                                         ▪   training and personal application of the proponents
                                         ▪   potential impact of the expected research results

                                         ▪   budget proposed for the research

                              Once the capsule proposal is approved by the URDE, the researcher shall prepare
                       a detailed proposal.  On the other hand, disapproved proposals will have to be revised
                       and be subjected to another review.

                       Section 3.  Budget Allocation


                                     For  institutionalized  researches,  the  Research  Director  endorses  the
                              proposal  to  the  University  President  for  final  approval  and  budget  allocation.
                              Research proposals that require funding from external agencies/sources also pass
                              through  the  usual  system  of  evaluation.    Once  approved  by  the  Council,  the
                              University President forwards the proposals to the funding agency Researches
                              seeking external fund must conform to the requirements and procedures of the
                              funding agency like PCIERD, PCARRD, DOST, DA, CHED, DENR, DOE etc.

                       Section 4. Approval of Research Proposal


                                     For institutionalized researches, the researcher will receive a “Notice to
                              Proceed” from the VPRDE with the Director for Research and Division Chief copy
                              furnished  signaling  the  conduct  of  research.  For  externally  funded  researches,
                              once  approved by  the Council,  the University President  forwards the research
                              proposal to the funding agency and the proponent will wait for the release of fund
                              for conduct of research.

                       APPENDIX 14. PROTECTING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES OF
                                     CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

                       I. Rationale
                              Republic Act No. 8293, otherwise known as the Intellectual Property Code of the
                       Philippines, states that:

                              “The State recognizes that an effective intellectual and industrial property system
                       is  vital  to  the  development  of  domestic  and  creative  activity,  facilitates  transfers  of
                       technology, attracts foreign investments, and ensures market access for our products.  It
                       shall protect and secure the exclusive rights of scientist, inventors, artists and other gifted
                       citizens to their intellectual property and creations, particularly when beneficial to the
                       people.”

                              With the various intellectual properties (IP’s) developed in the university such as
                       the  Aguinaldo  Blend  Coffee,  processed  products,  design  for  biogas  digester  and
                       innumerable research outputs being presented for public consumption, a few of them
                       were able to acquire protection. The biogas digester was just recently granted a patent,
                       while research outputs/publications have been presented without copyright protection,
                       except for some that were able to acquire ISBN registration from the National Library.
                       Therefore,  the  University  must  develop  a  system  for  protecting  economically  viable
                       intellectual properties to maximize gains that could finance more researches in the future.

                              “Intellectual Property or IP” is an asset that possesses commercial value which can
                       be exploited to generate revenue. IP value lies in its utilization, not existence.

                              “Intellectual Property Rights” or “IPR” refers to the entitlement and enjoyment of
                       the attributes of ownership over intellectual properties. IPR consists of: a) Copyright and

                              “Patent” is a grant issued by the Philippine government giving an inventor the
                       right  to  exclude  others  from  making,  using,  setting,  or  importing  the  product  of  his
                       invention within the Philippines in exchange of his patentable information or disclosure.

                              “Patentable inventions”      means  any  technical  solution  of a  problem in any
                       field  of  human  activity  which  is  new,  involves  an  inventive  step  and  is  industrially
                       applicable, which may be, or may related to a product, or process, or an improvement of
                       any of the foregoing.

                              “Plant  variety”  means  a  plant  grouping  within  a  single  botanical  taxon  of  the
                       lowest known rank which can be defined by the expression of the characteristics resulting
                       from a given genotype, or combination of genotypes, distinguished from any other plant
                       groupings by the expression of at least one characteristic and considered as a unit with
                       regard to the suitability for being propagated unchanged. A variety may be represented
                       by seed, transplants, plants, tubers, and tissue culture plantlets.

                              “Prior art”    Everything made available to the public by means of a written or
                       oral disclosure, by use, or in any other way, before the filing date or the priority date of
                       the application claiming the invention. Prior use which is not present in the Philippines,
                       even if widespread in a foreign country, cannot form part of the prior art if such prior use
                       is not disclosed in printed documents or in any tangible form.

                       III. Objective


                              To  establish  a  system  protecting  the  intellectual  properties  (IP’s)  or
                       results/products generated through researches conducted in the university.

                       IV. Strategy

                              The University shall establish an IPR Office that covers all intellectual property
                       protection activities and provide trainings/seminars to researchers to increase awareness


                       1  Section 4, R.A. 8293 (1998); TRIPS.
                       2  Section 21, R.A. 8293 (1998).

                       on IPR. The IPR Office will be divided in to two sections, each having IPR Assistants, one
                       for patentable IP’s and the other for publishable IP’s.

                              The IPR Officer will work under the Office of the Vice-President for Research,
                       Extension,  Continuing  Education  and  Training  Services  (RECETS),  and  is  tasked  to
                       identify,  protect  and  exploit  commercially  on  the  University’s  behalf  the  intellectual
                       property rights generated by the University’s researchers.


                              The IPR Officer will be involved in identifying and protecting the University’s
                       intellectual property rights, and in conforming to existing systems in managing, recording
                       and tracking the progress of intellectual property applications and commercialization of
                       the property. The IPR Officer will be required to work in close coordination with both
                       research and academic units of the university to identify research results and intellectual
                       property  rights  with  commercial  potential.  In  this  capacity  the  IPR  Assistants  will  be
                       responsible  for  applying  for  and  liquidating  cash  advances  accrued  during  the
                       applications and payment of other fees pertinent to the application. Where necessary the
                       IPR Officer will work with the University’s legal advisers.


                              The IPR Officer and IPR Assistants will be provided with appropriate external
                       training to ensure that they can become competent in all aspects of the role.

                              Other responsibilities include the following:


                              Formulate,    propose     and     implement      governing     guidelines    in
                       patenting/copyrighting research results in the University


                              Deal  with  agencies  requesting  for  commercialization  rights  for  patented/
                       copyrighted materials from the university, enter into licensing agreements and manage
                       the payment of royalties.


                              Monitor violations and persecute violators for patents/copyrights issued to the
                       university.


                       V. Implementation

                              The  CvSU-Intellectual  Property  Office  (CvSU-IPO)  shall  head  two  units,
                       Patentable IP Unit and Publishable IP Unit, each having IPR Assistants and will work in
                       consultation with the legal authority of the University;

                       APPENDIX 14. PROTECTING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES OF
                                     CAVITE STATE UNIVERSITY

                       I. Rationale
                              Republic Act No. 8293, otherwise known as the Intellectual Property Code of the
                       Philippines, states that:

                              “The State recognizes that an effective intellectual and industrial property system
                       is  vital  to  the  development  of  domestic  and  creative  activity,  facilitates  transfers  of
                       technology, attracts foreign investments, and ensures market access for our products.  It
                       shall protect and secure the exclusive rights of scientist, inventors, artists and other gifted
                       citizens to their intellectual property and creations, particularly when beneficial to the
                       people.”

                              With the various intellectual properties (IP’s) developed in the university such as
                       the  Aguinaldo  Blend  Coffee,  processed  products,  design  for  biogas  digester  and
                       innumerable research outputs being presented for public consumption, a few of them
                       were able to acquire protection. The biogas digester was just recently granted a patent,
                       while research outputs/publications have been presented without copyright protection,
                       except for some that were able to acquire ISBN registration from the National Library.
                       Therefore,  the  University  must  develop  a  system  for  protecting  economically  viable
                       intellectual properties to maximize gains that could finance more researches in the future.


                       II. Definition of Terms

                              “Copyright”  is  the  protection  extended  to  expressions  and  not  to  ideas,
                       procedures,  and  methods  of  operations  or  mathematical  concepts  as  such.  Such
                       expressions may be in the forms of literary, scholarly, scientific and artistic works.


                              “Intellectual Property or IP” is an asset that possesses commercial value which can
                       be exploited to generate revenue. IP value lies in its utilization, not existence.

                              “Intellectual Property Rights” or “IPR” refers to the entitlement and enjoyment of
                       the attributes of ownership over intellectual properties. IPR consists of: a) Copyright and
                       related rights; b) Trademarks and Service Marks; c) Geographic Indications; d) Industrial
                       Designs;  e)  Patents;  f)  Layout-Designs  (Topographies)  of  Integrated  Circuits;  and  g)
                       Protection  of  Undisclosed  Information.   IPR  shall  likewise  include  plant  varieties  and

                              “Patent” is a grant issued by the Philippine government giving an inventor the
                       right  to  exclude  others  from  making,  using,  setting,  or  importing  the  product  of  his
                       invention within the Philippines in exchange of his patentable information or disclosure.


                              “Patentable inventions”      means  any  technical  solution  of a  problem in any
                       field  of  human  activity  which  is  new,  involves  an  inventive  step  and  is  industrially

                              For the graduate level, members of the advisory committee recommend potential
                       candidates  to  the  department  where  the  student  belongs.  The  selection  committee
                       composed  of  the  chairman  and  the  faculty  members  then  selects  one  outstanding
                       thesis/dissertation for the department.
                              Theses selected for each department in both undergraduate and graduate levels
                       are submitted to the head of the college screening committee and Office of the Graduate
                       School, respectively.

                       College/Graduate Level
                              From all nominees in each department, the selection committee composed of the
                       dean, department chairpersons and college research coordinator selects one outstanding
                       undergraduate thesis for the college.
                              For the graduate level, the selection committee, composed of the dean, secretary
                       and chairpersons, selects the best MS thesis and PhD dissertation for each graduate degree
                       program.

                       Final Selection Level
                              The best thesis for each college and graduate programs are then submitted to the
                       director for research for final screening.
                              All nominees from each college are evaluated by a screening committee composed
                       of the RDE Council and the college research coordinators.
