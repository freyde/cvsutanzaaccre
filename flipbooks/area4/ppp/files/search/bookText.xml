             PARAMETER A


                I.  SYSTEMS – INPUTS AND PROCESSES

                      The BOR/BOT approved the Student Services Program

                               The Students Services Program of the University is under the Office of Student
                       Affairs and Services (OSAS) of the University. Through the years, the office had undergone a
                       series of renaming it was changed to Student Services Project in 1986, Student Services in
                       1989, Student Welfare Services in 1991 and renamed again to Office of Student Affairs in
                       1998 when DSAC was elevated into university, currently known as Cavite State University. The
                       different services offered by OSA and its guidelines are stated in the student handbook and
                       were based in the CvSU Manual of Operation 2009 which was approved by the Board of
                       Regents  (BOR)  on  September  3,  2009  per  Res.  No.  85,  s.  2009.  To  include  relevant
                       information about the university, the student handbook was updated and approved by the
                       BOR per Res. No. 84, s. 2006.

                               When  the  Commission  on  Higher  Education  promulgated  the  "Enhanced  Policies
                       and Guidelines on Student Affair and Services" on April 19, 2013 (CMO no. 19, s. 2013), the
                       Office  of  Student  Affairs  conducted  a  workshop  on  September  22,  2014  to  review  and
                       revise  its  existing  policies  and  guidelines  with  reference  to  the  enhanced  policies  and
                       guidelines from CHED. As an output, a proposal to rename the OSA to OSAS was made
                       as well as the revision of the composition and organizational structure of the unit.

                               In December 19, 2014, the OSA was officially renamed to Office of Student Affairs
                       and Services (OSAS) by virtue of BOR Resolution no. 77, s. 2014. The office provides
                       different student services to its client such as guidance and counseling,  admission and
                       testing, and student development services to like student organization and socio-cultural
                       affairs,  student  publication  and  placement  of  students  and  graduates.  The  mandated
                       National Service Training Program (NSTP) subject was also offered by the office since 2002.
                       And  as  a  sign  of  commitment  to  serve  its  client  efficiently,  the  OSAS  conducted  another
                       workshop on review and revision of the student Welfare Service of the CVSU Manual of
                       Operation last June 14-16, 2016 with reference to CMO no. 19, s. 2013. While waiting for
                       the BOR approval of the revised Student Welfare Services, the Office continue and remain
                       committed  to  provide  student  welfare  and  development  activities to  the CvSU academic
                       community and the public.

                III.  OUTCOMES
                      Students  are  knowledgeable  and  satisfied  with  the  operations/services  of  the  Student
                       Services Program

                               The following are examples of situations showing that the students of the University
                       are knowledgeable and satisfied  with the  operations/services  of the Student Services
                       Program:
                       A.  Orientation programs are conducted regularly during the start of the academic year.
                           This is done to create a welcoming environment that could build a sense of community
                           among the Freshmen, transferees, faculty, staff and other students. The overview of the
                           University Student Services as well as the students' rights and privileges, student code
                           of conduct, prohibited acts  and intuitional policies are discussed to help  the students
                           understand  and  be  familiar  to  the  environment  of  the  University,  the  educational
                           opportunities  that  they  can  avail  such  as  the  different  scholarships  offered  by  the
                           University.

                       B.  Student handbooks were distributed to student so that they can read, understand and
                           engage in all facets of being a student.

                       C.  Since the millennial generation of students nowadays are fond of using social networks,
                           the  different  Student  Services  Programs  of  the  OSAS  as  well  as  other  information
                           related  to  the  University  are  now  accessible  to  the  University  website  through
                           www.cvsu.edu.ph.

                       D.     Students  as  represented  by  the  different  student  leaders  who  were  involved  in  the

                       revision, evaluation and planning of the student services program. This was manifested
                       during the workshop on the revision of the Student Welfare Services where student leaders
                       are part of the committees involved in the workshop. This gave the opportunities to the
                       students  to  be  more  aware  on  the  procedures  done  in  the  formulation  of  policies  and
                       guidelines  in  the  University.  This  may  also  increase  students'  sense  of  engagement  or
                       attachment to the University.

                       E.  As  part  of  the  Student  Enhancement  Activities,  students  were  allowed  to  conduct
                           different extracurricular activities that do not fall into the realm of their normal curriculum
                           of  school.  It  gave  them  more  opportunities  to  learn  the  values  of  teamwork  and
                           responsibility.  The  OSAS  as  well  as  the  other  University  officials  provided  prompt,
                           courteous and efficient services and supports to them since the activities are still part of
                           what is mandated in the student handbook or in the University Operational Manual and
                           gave benefits for the welfare of the students.

                       F.  Evaluation  of  student  services  was  done  to  determine  the  level  of  satisfaction  of
                           students to the different Student Services offered by the University.

                       University's  expression  of  concern  to  assist  students  in  understanding  the  diversity,
                       intensity and extent of personal experiences as well as the opportunities available and the
                       many choices open to them. Moreover, students are assisted to recognize, interpret and
                       act upon their personal strengths and resources thereby developing individuals who can
                       plan  their  work  sensibly  and  solve  their  problems  with  grace  and  high  sense  of  moral
                       values.

                               The program generally aims to assist in the development of students who are well
                       informed, self-directed and adjusted.

                               Specifically, the organized guidance services are designed to assist students to:
                               a.  Evaluate their needs, abilities, achievements, aptitudes, interests, etc.
                               b.  Make the best adjustment in school
                               c.  Make decision about their program of studies and works
                               d.  Think through their problems
                               e.  Appreciate themselves and others



                       Program Highlights

                               The thrust of the program is preventive and developmental rather than redemptive
                       and disciplinary. It focuses on the strengths of individuals, which can be utilized by them in
                       decision  making  and  problem  solving.  In  order  to  facilitate  the  preventive  development
                       concerns  of  the  program,  five  basic  guidance  services  were  identified.  These  include:
                       appraisal service, information service, counseling service, planning, placement and follow
                       up  and  consultation  services.  The  program  recognizes  the  role  of  both  human  and
                       physical resources toward effective and efficient implementation of the program. On the
                       part of human resources, emphasis is focused on the need for a full time, well trained and
                       competent  staff.  This  part  of  the  program  will  put  emphasis  on  continuous  training,
                       upgrading and intellectual development and recruitment of guidance personnel. Physical
                       resources are deemed important for the sound implementation of the plan. In relation to
                       this, acquisition of materials and equipment, like testing materials and computer units, will
                       be made.

                       service to the students.

                                IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES ON BASIC GUIDANCE SERVICES

                       1.  Orientation Services
                                  The initial challenge that confronts the Guidance Services Unit is how to inform
                           students their rights, privileges and responsibilities as soon as they become a bonafide
                           student of the Cavite State University. Hence, orientation service is necessary for the
                           students  to  cope  with  the  new  surroundings  and  how  to  adhere  with  the  set  of
                           academic rules and regulations as well as to the university's norm of conduct.

                       2.  Appraisal Services
                           A.  Individual Inventory Service
                                      All  incoming  freshmen/transferees  are  required  to  fill  out  individual
                               Inventory Record Form a week after the commencement of classes. The form will
                               become part of the official documents of each student.


                           B.  Testing Services
                                      This process of collecting information about a student includes the proper
                               use  of  standardized  tests  and  inventories.  These  are  tests  of  mental  ability,
                               aptitude and achievement, which could help predict how well an individual may be
                               expected  to  profit  from  future  training.  While  inventories  include  occupational
                               interests,  study  habits  and  skills,  values,  attitudes  which  provide  qualitative  data
                               needed about the individual.

                                      Through the abovementioned services, faculty counselors, instructors and
                               other school officials may advise/request the students to visit the Guidance Office
                               as need arises or deemed necessary.

                       3.  Information Services
                                 This service intends to provide students with information in three major areas of

                                      The Guidance/Faculty Counselor should prepare an orientation program for
                               all  freshmen,  transferees  and  returnees.  This  will  help  students  gain  insights
                               regarding  the  policies,  guidelines,  services  provided/offered,  and  all  information
                               that a student should know about the University.

                                      Guidance/Faculty  Counselor  should  provide  orientation  for  the  parents.
                               Guidance/Faculty/Counselor  is  the  one  responsible  in  updating  the  Bulletin  of
                               Information. The Bulletin should contain the following information:
                                  a.  Provisions on scholarships

                               wide  orientation  program  before  the  opening  of  classes.  Parents/guardians  are
                               also requested to attend so that they are also well-informed of the guidelines that
                               the university is implementing.

                           B.  Personal-Social Aspect
                                      The office of the Guidance Counselor should have bookshelves containing
                               reading  materials  regarding  personality  development,  relationship,  health  and
                               leisure,  etc.  The  Guidance  Office  should  provide  CD's  or  tapes  that  contains
                               information on current trends and issues, or they may provide regular film showing.

                       problems with moral values.

                       well informed, self-directed and adjusted.

                                  Any  student  activity  that  is  subversive  in  nature  and  one  which  incites
                           insurgency  including  those  against  the  existing  University  Rules  and  regulations  is

                           faculty  coordinator  if  warranted  by  the  circumstances  of  each  case  shall  be  held

                           Penalty for Violation

                                  In  addition  to  the  revocation  of  the  authority  to  operate,  the  student
                           organization may be reprimanded, suspended or dropped from the roll of the school or
                           expelled from the University depending on the seriousness of the offense committed.

                      There are institutional guidelines on Student Grievance.

                               As  guidance  services  represents  the  University's  expression  of  concern  for  the
                       students, it is likewise expected that personal experiences of each student shall be treated
                       as  stage  that  they  need  to  pass  through  even  if  sometimes  those  experiences  signify
                       negative  quality.  This  is  the  stage  where  Student  Formation  program  will  play  a  very
                       important role. As students are helped to face the consequences of their actions, they will
                       also undergo series of activities that will help them re-gain self-confidence and self-trust as
                       well as their self-esteem.

                               Within  the  Student  Formation  section  is  the  Student  Discipline  unit,  with  the
                       following functions:

                             Conduct hearing of student cases;
                             File formal charges upon respondents in cases where complaints or report is found
                               supported by evidences; and
                             Submit  to  higher  authorities  the  complete  report  of  student  cases  containing
                               findings on fact, conclusion and recommendation.
