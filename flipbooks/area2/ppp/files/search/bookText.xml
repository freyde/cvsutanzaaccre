                II.  IMPLEMENTATION

                      The  institution  has  clear  systems  and  procedures  in  the  recruitment,  selection  and
                       promotion of faculty as embodied in the BOR/BOT and CSC approved Merit Selection and
                       Promotion Plan for faculty and other institution guidelines  in terms of mandatory and/or
                       optional criteria; open competition and in-breeding policy.

                               The new faculty members are recruited based on the need of the department.  The
                       head of the department will make a request for authority from the Campus Administrator to
                       fill-up  vacant  positions  for  the  said  department.    If  the  Campus  Administrator  finds  the
                       request meritorious, the HRMO announces the existing vacant positions as per advice of
                       the Campus Administrator.  The hiring system adopts an open competitive selection, based
                       on CSC approved Merit System and Promotion Plan of the Institution, published and well-
                       disseminated through social media (Facebook) and announcement in bulletin boards.  After
                       the  two-week  announcement  period,  interested  applicants  are  called  for  demonstration
                       teaching, interview and screening procedures.

                               The  applicants  are  screened  by  the  faculty  and  academic  staff  selection  board
                       composed of the campus administrator as the chairperson, campus local human resource
                       management officer and department chairs as members.

                               The applicant is rated using the following criteria:  30% educational qualification,
                       20%  teaching  demonstration,  10%  interview,  10%  licensure  examination  and  30%  plus
                       factor (scholastic ability, talent, work experience, potentials and professional development).
                       Qualified applicants are recommended to the University President for approval.  Applicants
                       who qualified are required to undergo and pass the medical and psychological examinations
                       prior to appointment.

                      The institution practices the conduct of Orientation/Re-orientation of New/Old Faculty (to
                       include the topics, lectures, workshop sessions during the Orientation Program).

                               Orientation/Re-orientation programs are conducted regularly during the start of the
                       semester.    All  faculty  members,  regardless  of  status,  are  required  to  attend  the  said
                       program.  This is done to disseminate information to the new/old faculty members about the
                       university vision and mission, quality policies, rules and regulations, among others to help
                       the  newly-hired  faculty  members  to  adjust  to  teaching,  especially  those  who  were  non-
                       Education graduates.

                               Before the start of each semester, a capability enhancement program is organized
                       to share and gain knowledge and enhance the innovative teaching techniques to be used
                       in  the  classroom  teaching.    Some  of  the  highest  ranking  faculty  members  discuss  the
                       following topics:

                      The institution conducts different in-service trainings and workshops to further enhance the
                       faculty capability in their trilogy functions: instruction, research, and extension activities.

                IV. BEST PRACTICES

                      Efficient recruitment and selection process has been utilized to hire the best  and highly
                       qualified faculty members.

                      Orientation of faculty members is regularly conducted at the start of the semester.

                      Newly  hired  faculty  members  are  required  to  attend  capability  Training  for  Teachers  to
                       ensure quality and sufficient teaching.

                      The institution has formulated a screening committee who will evaluate faculty applicants in
                       their teaching demonstration, interview and other screening procedures who select the most
                       qualified faculty member/s to teach the required discipline.

                      The  HRMO  posts  advertisement  or  announcements  of  hiring  in  social  media,  bulletin
                       boards, and other platforms to attract the best faculty applicants.

                      Orientation/Re-Orientation and other capacity-building programs are conducted regularly to
                       ensure the development of competencies among faculty members.

             PARAMETER C – FACULTY ADEQUACY AND LOADING

                I.  SYSTEMS – INPUTS AND PROCESSES

                      The institution has an Approved Policies/Guideline on Faculty Workload by the University
                       BOR including institutional policies o Equivalent Teaching Load (ETL).

                       Specific Policies and Guidelines on Faculty Workload
                               The  workload  system  shall  be  implemented  by  the  University  in  line  with  the
                       guidelines  on  faculty  workload  policies  and  regulations  by  CHED.  The  current  faculty
                       workload system may be revised or totally replaced upon approval of the Board.

                               The workload system concerns only the instruction function and related activities of
                       the academic teaching staff of Cavite State University. This was finalized on 14 July 2000
                       incorporating the comments/suggestions of the University Administrative Council during its
                       03 July 2000 meeting. Amendments and revisions   were again made in December 2002
                       and  May  2007  for  the  following  purposes,  among  others:  define  credit  units  for  other
                       activities left to the discretion of the College/Campus Dean, specify the mode of payment
                       for overload teaching and overtime teaching; and suggest      source  of  funds  for  such
                       payment.

                               Section  1.  Coverage.  This  set  of  guidelines  covers  all  CvSU  faculty  members,
                       whether permanent, temporary, or contractual teachers reporting on full time.

                               a.  At the beginning of each school year, before the start of regular   classes,  the
                                  college/campus deans shall require the members of         their   faculty   to
                                  decide whether to be on full-time teaching,  research  or  extension,  provided
                                  that the needs of instruction are satisfied first and does not lead to extra hiring of
                                  personnel.

                                         It should be noted, however, that although faculty members are classified
                                  as  full-time  teachers,  they  are  still  required  to  conduct  either  research  or
                                  extension activities on top of their teaching loads. The list of those on full-time
                                  teaching shall be submitted immediately to the office of the Vice President for
                                  Academic Affairs (OVPAA) while those on full-time research or extension shall
                                  be endorsed by OVPAA to the Office of the Vice President for Research and
                                  Development.  For efficient allocation of funds, tentative computation of faculty
                                  workload for instruction shall be submitted to OVPAA one week, at the latest,
                                  before the start of classes in each semester.

                               b.  Faculty  members  with  academic  ranks  who  opt  for  full–time  research  or
                                  extension shall be required to teach minimum of (9)       contact  hours  per
                                  week.

                               c.  Credit unit load of faculty members on full–time research or extension shall be
                                  covered  by  a  separate  research  and  extension  workload  system  of  the
                                  University.

                               Section 2.  Maximum Workload and Overload Compensation







                        Area II: Faculty                                                                  34]]></page><page Index="35"><![CDATA[PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                                                    BSIT




                                      The maximum regular teaching load of an academic full – time teaching staff
                               without administrative and supervisory assignment in any given semester shall be
                               18 teaching hours (TCH) per week. (TCH) and equivalent WL units shall be reduced
                               to 18 and 25, respectively effective First Semester, AY 2004 – 2005 depending on
                               availability  of  funds).  For  purposes  of  overload  pay,  this  is  equivalent  to  the
                               maximum of 25 instruction workload (WL) credit units

                               a.  The regular workload of full–time teaching staff in a given   semester   shall
                                  include only those related to instruction, administrative assignments and other
                                  services duly supported by designations issued by the Office of the President of
                                  the University (OUP) as recommended by the vice president concerned.

                               b.  Faculty members who opt to be on full-time teaching but who conduct important
                                  projects under the priority commodity thrusts of the University shall earn credit
                                  units for those projects based on the guidelines for  research  and  extension
                                  workload. This credit unit shall be added to  instruction  workload  provided  that
                                  these credit units are not credited on full-time research.

                               c.  The final  report on faculty  workload, including the summary thereof, shall be
                                  submitted to the office of the  Vice  President  for  Academic  Affairs  for
                                  consolidation   within the final examination period of every semester.

                               d.  An academic staff who is unable to reach the maximum teaching load per week
                                  shall be required to teach other courses in other units of the University and/or
                                  render  other  services  deemed  necessary  as  recommended  by  the  Vice
                                  President for Academic Affairs and approved by the University President in order
                                  to reach the mandatory 40-hour service per week required of all government
                                  personnel.  In no case, however, shall the conduct of other services lead to hiring
                                  of additional part-time or full- time faculty member. Hiring will only be done when
                                  all faculty members are fully loaded at 18 TCH each per week. Exemptions to
                                  the required 18 TCH, are faculty members with management and supervisory
                                  designations specified. The assigning of such other services shall be endorsed
                                  by  the  Vice  President  of  Academic  Affairs  for  approval  by  the  University
                                  President.

                               e.  In case faculty members carrying the full load of 18 TCH are given extra teaching
                                  assignment  scheduled  outside  the  official  time,  such  assignment  shall  be
                                  covered by a job order in order for the faculty member to receive   equitable
                                  remuneration.

                               f.  The detailed guidelines for faculty workload system shall be prepared, reviewed
                                  and revised periodically by the Academic Council taking into account the policies
                                  listed above.

                      There is an institutional approved workload guidelines.

                       Section 7. Basic Requirements of Scholarship

                               Scholars should enroll the required regular load during the semestral or summer
                       classes. Regular load means twelve (12) units per semester, nine (9) units per trimester and
                       quarterm, and six (6) units of academic subjects during summer. A load of nine (9) units
                       may be allowed during the  initial semester or six (6) units during the  initial trimester or
                       quarterm of coursework upon prior approval of the Scholarship Committee. The scholars
                       should coordinate with the FSDO before finalizing their coursework in order to ensure that
                       the load requirement is satisfied.

                               In case the intended course to be enrolled is dissolved or has reached the quota for
                       the  required  number  of  enrollees  and  no  substitute  course  is  allowed  by  the  graduate
                       committee,  the  scholar’s  stipend  will  be  pro-rated  based  on  his  load  during  the
                       semester/trimester. The scholar will be required to reinstate if he does not have any subject
                       to enroll for reasons stated above.

                       Section 8. Change of Specialization

                               The selection of scholars is based on specific fields of specialization. The scholars
                       cannot change their field of specialization or major course of work without prior authorization
                       from the University. A change in the field of study/specialization and school shall not be
                       allowed specially if it requires additional period of scholarship and additional expense on
                       part of the University except  in certain  meritorious cases beyond their control.  The unit
                       heads/deans should justify that the change would benefit their unit/college in particular and
                       the  University  in  general.  If  a  faculty  member  pursued  a  program  authorized  by  the
                       University  but  which  is  not  in  line  with  his  field  of  specialization  or  not  needed  by  his
                       college/unit,  he  will  be  required  to  transfer  to  another  college/unit  within  the  University
                       System that needs such field of study/specialization.

                               A  scholar  who  changes  his  field  of  specialization  without  prior  approval  will  be
                       required to reinstate and refund in full all expenses incurred during his scholarship to include
                       tuition and other fees, stipend, book allowance, thesis allowance, salary and other financial
                       incentives.
                       Section 9. Leave of Absence

                               A total maximum leave of absence equivalent to one school year may be granted to
                       the faculty member or staff on scholarship upon prior request based on meritorious reasons
                       subject to the submission of an approved LOA from the graduate school and approval of
                       the University President upon recommendation of the Scholarship Committee. The scholar
                       on LOA shall be required to reinstate to the University and shall not be entitled to allowances
                       of a scholar. The period of reinstatement is good only for the length of the approved LOA
                       unless otherwise approved by higher authorities.

                               Faculty members and staff on scholarship are allowed a maximum of two (2) years
                       to  finish  their  MA/MS/MBA/related  degrees  and  three  (3)  years  to  finish  their
                       Ph.D./DBA/related degrees excluding the period of their approved LOA.

                       Section 11. Extension of Scholarship

                               Extension of scholarship beyond the period specified in Section 10 may be allowed
                       only for five (5) months with full privileges upon certification of the Adviser that the scholar
                       can  finish  the  course  within  the  extension  period  and  the  Scholarship  Committee  has
                       determined  that  normal  credit  loads  have  been  taken  every  semester.  An  additional
                       extension for less than or maximum of five (5) months only on official time and without
                       stipend could be granted for meritorious reasons and certification of the adviser and/or dean
                       of the graduate school.

                               In case of  completion of thesis or dissertation beyond the allowable scholarship
                       period, (3 years for MS/MA/MBA and 4 years for Ph.D./DBA), the grantee shall be required
                       to reinstate to the University while completing the thesis/dissertation requirements and is no
                       longer entitled to scholarship privileges.

                       Section 12. Completion of Degree

                               A scholar, upon completion of degree, should submit within three (3) months an
                       article for publication in the University Research Journal based on his study and bound
                       copies of his thesis or dissertation to the University Library, FSDO, Research Center and
                       Quality Assurance and Accreditation Center. Further, a scholar should present a paper to
                       the local Agency In-House Review or other venues as may be coordinated by the Research
                       Center.

                       Section 13. Obligations of Scholars

                               The scholar, before commencing studies, should agree to the following terms and
                       conditions:

                               a.  To conduct himself in a manner so as not to bring disgrace or dishonor to the
                                  University and to the country;

                               b.  Any  misconduct  such  as  immorality,  assault  on  authority,  excessive
                                  drunkenness, inciting rebellion or sedition or a combination of the same, and acts
                                  not  in  conformity  with  the  Code  of  Conduct  for  Government  Employees  (RA
                                  6713)  are  grounds  for  immediate  termination  of  scholarship,  pending
                                  investigation  and  subsequent  legal  proceedings  against  the  scholar  in
                                  accordance with Civil Service and other government rules and regulations;

                               c.  To keep up with the high standards of scholarship;

                                         The grantee should understand that scholarship is both a privilege and a
                                  responsibility. It  is the  responsibility of a scholar to behave as a responsible
                                  scholar at all times. He is therefore required to maintain a grade point average
                                  of 2.00 for graduate courses (or their equivalent requirements) at the end of
                                  every semester. A GPA below these requirements shall automatically lose his

                       university for a decade or more and still choose to stay.  The table shows the length of
                       service and rank of each faculty.

                           University shall adopt its own performance   evaluation system for all its personnel. This
                           performance evaluation system is designed to:

                           a.  Continuously foster improvement of employee’s performance and efficiency;

                           b.  Enhance organizational effectiveness and productivity;

                           c.  Provide an objective performance rating which shall serve as a basis for incentive
                               and  rewards,  promotion,  training  and  development,  personnel  sanctions  and
                               administrative sanctions;

                               corresponding  performance  measures  which  shall  be  mutually  agreed  upon
                               between  supervisors  and  subordinates  for  a  particular  appraisal  period.  The
                               performance of the employee shall be evaluated on the basis of his accomplishment
                               as against his performance target;

                           e.  Provide  opportunity  for  supervisors  to  make  comments  and  recommendations

                               furthering  his  career,  or  identifying  factors  that  may  impede  his  development.
                               Comments  from  supervisors  are  expected  to  facilitate  the  employee’s  personal
                               growth and shall be given due weight in making personnel decisions; and

                           f.  Provide  sanctions  against  raters  who  use  the  performance  rating  to  give  undue
                               advantage and disadvantage to people they rate.

                       Performance Rating

                           his targets by at least 30 percent. It represents an extraordinary level of achievement
                           and commitment in terms of quality and time, technical knowledge and skill, ingenuity,
                           creativity and initiative. Employee at this performance level should have demonstrated
                           exceptional  job  mastery  in  all  major  aspects  of  responsibility.  His  achievement  and
                           contributions  to  the  organization  are  of  marked  excellence  which  his  peers  and
                           supervisors recognize.

                                  Only employees with Outstanding and Very Satisfactory Performance Ratings
                           for two consecutive rating periods shall be considered for promotion.


                       c)  Satisfactory – An employee of the University shall be given this rating when he meets

                           period, the employee under close supervision, will either improve his performance for
                           which he shall be given a satisfactory rating. Two (2) successive Unsatisfactory Ratings
                           shall be a ground for separation from the service.

                             such leave from the fund out of which the salary would have been paid.

                       f.    When  a  person  whose  leave  has  been  commuted  following  his  separation  is  re-
                             appointed in the government before the expiration of the leave commuted, he is given
                             two options, as follows:

                             can choose either of the following modes relative to his unused vacation and or sick

                             service cancel any previously scheduled leave.

                       j.    The mandatory annual five – day vacation leave shall be forfeited if not taken during
                             the year. However in cases where the scheduled leave has been cancelled in the
                             exigency of the service by the University President, the scheduled leave not enjoyed
                             shall no longer be deducted from the total accumulated vacation leave.

                             more of continuous service shall, in addition to the vacation and sick leave granted to
                             them, be entitled to maternity leave of sixty (60) days with full pay. Maternity leave

                       l.    For those who have rendered less than two (2) years of government service at the
                             time of the enjoyment of maternity leave, the computation of their maternity leave pay
                             shall be proportionate to their length of service.

                      The system of compensating and rewarding the faculty is described as follows:

                                      System of Compensating and Rewarding the Faculty

                    a.  Basic of the faculty salary rates
                               The  salary  rate  of  faculty  is  determined  by  their  professional  ranks  and  the
                       corresponding  salary  grades  as  provided  for  in  existing  salary  standardization  scale  or
                       schedule  for  civilian/government  employees  which  took  effect  on  July  1,  2001.  The
                       professional rank in turn are based on the results of NBC evaluations for faculty members,
                       which are adjusted accordingly based on the results of evaluation.

                    b.  Other benefits (COLA, bonuses, etc)
                               Numbers of benefits are being provided to faculty members within particular year.
                       Examples  are  clothing  allowance,  bonus/cash  gift,  medical  allowance/assistance,
                       productivity incentives bonus and COLA. The granting of each specified benefit is based on
                       specific guidelines/procedures/memoranda/curricular/directives and similar issuances from




                        Area II: Faculty                                                                 126]]></page><page Index="127"><![CDATA[PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                                                    BSIT




                       concerned agencies and of the University. The amount, manner and time of granting these
                       benefits  as  well  as  who  are  covered  by  specified  benefits  depend  on  the  individual
                       provisions of their corresponding guidelines.

                    c.  Mode of overload teaching compensation
                               Faculty members are given overload pay every semester based on the Workload
                       System for Instruction. The overload compensation is monetary and service credit.

                               Part of the overload system is that of teaching assignments. The maximum regular
                       teaching load of a full time academic teaching staff without administrative or secondary
                       assignment in any given semester shall be 21 teaching contact lemurs (TCH) per week.

                               For  the  purpose  of  overload  pay,  this  load  is  equivalent  to  the  maximum  of  25
                       instruction  workload  (WL)  credits  units.  Units  in  excess  of  this  normal  load  are  given
                       corresponding remuneration. Payment for overload credit units of faculty members shall be
                       based on salary rates/hour multiplied by 18 weeks per credit unit beyond the maximum
                       teaching workload of 25 credit units. Provided that only a maximum load of six (6) teaching
                       hours per week (equivalent to 34.84 credit units i.e., 25+9 credit units shall be considered
                       for payment. Other excess units shall be considered as service credit for regular faculty.

             PARAMETER H – PROFESSIONALISM

                I.  SYSTEMS – INPUTS AND PROCESSES

                      There is Institutional Guidelines/Policies on Work Ethics, attendance in Classes, submission
                       of Academic Reports and Decorum.

                       Article 13. Assignment of Affiliate Faculty Members. An affiliate faculty member is one
                       who has his/her mother college but is also teaching in other college(s)/campus because of
                       his/her diversity of specialization or full knowledge of the subject(s) (BOR Res. No. 64, s,
                       2003, December 3, 2003).
                       A faculty member can get teaching load in another college(s)/ campus as long as he/she is
                       competent to teach the proposed subject(s) because these are either in line with his/her
                       minor field(s) or he/she has undergone retooling through intensive training.

                       The guidelines on assigning of affiliate faculty members to other college(s)/ campus of the
                       University shall be as follows:

                       a.  Arrangements on the possible teaching load shall be made between the Department
                           Chairs/Unit Heads of the mother college/project and college/campus where a faculty
                           member intends to teach. This is on the assumption that the faculty member has pre –
                           determined  the  subjects  he/she  can  possibly  teach  in  other  college(s).  Once  the
                           arrangement has been made, an appointment of the faculty member as an affiliate of
                           another  college(s)  or  its  equivalent  shall  be  prepared  for  confirmation  of  the  faculty
                           member and for approval of the Deans/Directors concerned.

                       b.  The  Department  Chair(s),  where  the  affiliate  faculty  member  is  assigned,  shall  be
                           informed  of  the  room  assignment(s)  to  insure  that  he  will  be  subjected  to  student
                           evaluation in that particular semester.

                       c.  An affiliate faculty member shall not be given lateral or non – teaching assignments by
                           the Heads of the College where he/she is given teaching load. He/She shall only report
                           to the college/campus during his/her scheduled classes.

                       d.  All the needed office and laboratory supplies required by the subject(s) being taught by
                           the affiliate faculty member shall be secured from the college/campus where the subject
                           (s) is being offered.

                       e.  An affiliate faculty member of a branch campus shall be provided traveling allowance
                           and per diem in the amount of P200.00 by the campus where he is given teaching load,
                           provided that the faculty member concerned leaves his office before 12 noon.

                       f.  An affiliate faculty member shall log in and out in the department(s) where she/he is
                           assigned to teach. This will serve as a basis in the giving of travel allowance if assigned
                           in the branch campus.
                      There  are  legal  documents  that  contain  policies  on  professionalism  adopted  by  the
                       Institution (RA 6713 & Code of Ethics of the Profession).
