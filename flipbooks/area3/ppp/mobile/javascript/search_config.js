Series of 2006.                                    “A  student  who  has  been  absent  from  classes  for  at  least  two  (2)                                   consecutive  meetings  must  obtain  an  excuse  slip  from  the  Office  of                                   Student Affairs and present this to the instructor concerned  on the day                                   he returns to class.

Scheduling and Conduct of Classes.                            a.  Course  Scheduling.  These  guidelines  pertain  to  tertiary  level  in  the  University.                                SELSHS follows a different set schedule.                                        The Office of the University Registrar is tasked to policy and oversight to                                course  scheduling.  The  College/Department  is  furnished  a  tentative  schedule  of                                courses  two  months  before  each  term,  which  will  be  used  to  decide  faculty                                assignment. The Department Head, through the Dean/Director, coordinates with the                                Office  of  the  University  Registrar  on  matters  concerning  the  final  scheduling  of                                courses  as  well  as  room  assignment.  Faculty  schedules  are  prepared  by  the                                Department Head after due consultations with the faculty members. The assignment                                of loads should be based on the existing policies of the institution    governing                                faculty loads. A tentative schedule is usually given to faculty members at least two                                (2) weeks before the opening of the semester to give them enough time to prepare.                                Loads are considered final once approved by the Dean and submitted to the Office                                of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. The Department Head and Dean of the                                College sign the official Report on Load of the faculty before it is forwarded to the                                Office of the University President.                             b.  Change of Class Schedule. The regular schedule of classes, as approved by the                                Department  Head  and  the  Dean,  should  be  observed  strictly.  Faculty  members                                should conduct their classes for instruction or consultation purposes on schedule.                                Faculty  members  should  first  inform,  consult  and  get  the  approval  of  their                                department  head  and  dean  should  there  be  changes  in  the  schedule.  Internal                                arrangements between faculty members and students are not allowed.

Class Size. A minimum number of students are required to open a   class:                                         Undergraduate                —      forty (40) students                                         Specialization/Majorship     —      fifteen (15) students                                         Masters                      —      ten (10) students                                         Doctoral                     —      eight (8) students                                         Special class- below         -—     ten (10) students;                                       Should the class size fall below the minimum number, the Department Head                                should  be  informed  immediately  to  decide  whether  to  dissolve  the  class  or  to                                maintain it as a special class approved by the Dean of the College. Should the class                                be dissolved, faculty members should advise the student to transfer to other classes.                            d.  First Day of Classes. During the first day of classes, faculty members should sign                                the registration forms of their students and collect their class cards or registration                                forms. The class cards serve as evidence that the students are officially enrolled in                                the class.                                       A student is considered officially enrolled only after the following steps are                                satisfied:                                      University  Registrar  has  duly  certified  the  enrollment  on  the  registration                                       cards.                                     University Cashier has stamped on the required forms an acknowledgement                                       of payment of fees, and                                     Professors/instructors  have  placed  their  initials  or  signatures  on  the                                       registration cards.                                        The class list, issued by the Office of the University Registrar, provides the                                name of the students, regular or  irregular, officially enrolled  in a course. Faculty                                members should get their class lists from their Department Head on the first day of                                classes.                                        Moreover, faculty members should orient the students about the objectives,                                contents  and  requirements  of  the  course,  and  explain  the  bases  for  evaluating                                students’ performance. It is recommended that the students be provided with a copy                                of the course syllabus.                             e.  Class Meetings and Dismissal of Classes. Punctuality should         be  observed                                at all times in the conduct of classes. If the class should start at 7 a.m., the faculty                                should be in the classroom at exactly                                        7 a.m. Classes should be dismissed at least five (5) minutes before the end                                of each period to allow students to move and transfer to their next class.                             f.  Make-Up Classes. Faculty members who miss their classes due to official functions                                should conduct make-up activities/classes. Make-up activities/classes should be for                                both extra and regular teaching assignments.

In  case  the  student  is  registered  in  another  unit  of  the                                University,  the  dean  shall  transmit  the  case  to  the  dean  of  the  other  unit  for                                disciplinary action.                                 For purposes of implementing the rules and regulations on discipline of students, the                                Bancod  road  traversing  the  campus,  while  not  officially  part  of  the  University                                campus, shall be considered within the jurisdiction of the University.                             c.

The University should not take any action on complaints regarding ordinary debts of                                students to private parties.  However, if the case clearly involves the moral character                                of the student, OSA may take disciplinary action.  If it is the case of indebtedness to                                the  University,  the  existing  rules  such  as  withholding  of  grades  shall  be  applied                                without  prejudice  to  the  authorities  taking  further  action  as  the  circumstances                                warrant.                             f.
