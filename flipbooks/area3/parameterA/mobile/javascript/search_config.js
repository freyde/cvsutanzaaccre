Robles, University President, designated university                program coordinators for the different curricula offered by the university (Office Memorandum No.                PHDR-77-17). The university program coordinators are tasked to oversee, monitor and ensure                 that  the  university  is  implementing  a  uniform  curricular  structure  for  each  curricular  program                offered  in  various  campuses;  and  that  the  programs  are  compliant  with  the  CHED  minimum                standards. They will spearhead the conduct of periodic review and evaluation of the curricular                 programs and proposed revisions or whenever necessary.                        The University BSIT Program Coordinator formed a committee to revise the curriculum                structure  of  the  program,  which  is  composed  of  different  program coordinators  from different                 campuses and selected faculty members of the BSIT program.                                                                                                         1 | P a g e","The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) released the latest CHED Memorandum                Order (CMO No. 25 Series 2015) on the Revised Policies, Standards and Guidelines for the                 Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Information Systems                (BSIS), and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), which was used as the basis                of the curriculum revision for the BSIT program. The revised curriculum structure of the program                 will be subjected for approval of the University Academic Council, Board of Regents and CHED                before its full implementation on the S.Y. 2018-2019.                  Objectives of the Curriculum Revision                         The general objective of the curriculum revision was to design a new curriculum structure                 for the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program based on the CMO No. 25                Series of 2015.                         Specifically, it aimed to:                        1.  compare the proposed curriculum to existing and CHED minimum standards;                        2.  prepare the breakdown of courses of the program; and                         3.  provide the checklist of the courses of the program per year and per semester.                 Strategies Performed on the Curriculum Revision                     •   The curriculum revision committee for BSIT was formed and consisted of the Program                        Coordinators from the main campus and each satellite campus.                    •   The first workshop on curriculum revision was held on August 10, 2017 at CvSU-CCAT                         Computer Laboratory.                    •   Initial draft of the revised BSIT curriculum was presented by the program coordinators to                         their respective campuses, department chairpersons and faculty from August 14 to 23,                        2017.                    •   The second workshop was held on August 24, 2017 on the same venue. Feedbacks from                         the campuses were integrated in the proposed revised curriculum.                    •   The BSIT proposed curriculum was presented in the CEIT Academic Council meeting on                        February 8, 2018 at CvSU-Main Campus. Some recommendations were applied.                     •   A  joint-curriculum  review  of  the  BSCS  and  the  BSIT  programs  was  conducted  last                        February 27, 2018 at CvSU-CCAT Hostel in the presence of external stakeholders.                    •   The outcomes of the review were presented to the Campus Academic Council of CvSU-                         CCAT on March 14, 2018.                                                                                                        2 | P a g e","Summary of Revisions on the BSIT Curriculum                         Table 1 shows the summary of revisions done on the curriculum structure of the Bachelor                 of Science in Information Technology program.

Art appreciation is a three-unit course that develops                             students’  ability  to  appreciate,  analyze,  and  critique  works  of  arts.  Through                             interdisciplinary and multimodal approaches, this course equips students with broad                             knowledge of the practical, historical, philosophical, and social relevance of the arts                             in order to hone students’ ability to articulate their understanding of the arts. The                             course also develops students’ competency in researching and curating art as well                             as conceptualizing, mounting and evaluating art productions.  The course aims to                             develop  students’  genuine  appreciation  for  Philippine  arts  by  providing  the,                             opportunities to explore the diversity and richness and their rootedness in Filipino                             culture.

Ethics deals with principles of ethical behavior in modern society                             at the level of the person, society and in interaction with the environment and other                             shared resources (CMO 20 s 2013). Morality pertains to the standards of right and                             wrong  that  an  individual  originally  picks  up  from  the  community.    The  course                             discusses the context and principles of ethical behavior in modern society at the level                             of  individual,  society  and  interaction  with  the  environment  and  other  shared                             resources.  The course also teaches students to make moral decisions by using                             dominant moral frameworks and by applying a seven-step moral reasoning model to                             analyze and solve moral dilemmas. The course is organized according to the three                             (3)  main  elements  of  the  moral  experience  (a)  agent,  including  context-cultural,                             communal, and environmental; (b) the act; and (c) reason or framework (for the act).

Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Technology                              GNED 03 - Mathematics in the Modern World. This course deals with nature of                             mathematics, appreciation of its practical, intellectual, and aesthetic dimensions, and                             application of mathematical tools in daily life The course begins with an introduction                             to  the  nature  of  mathematics  as  an  exploration  of  patterns  (in  nature  and  the                             environment)  and  as  an  application  of  inductive  and  deductive  reasoning.  By                             exploring  these  topics,  students  are  encouraged  to  go  beyond  the  typical                             understanding  of  mathematics  as  merely  a  set  of  formulas  but  as  a  source  of                             aesthetics in patterns of nature, for example, and a rich language in itself (and of                             science) governed by logic and reasoning.    The course then proceeds to survey                             ways  in  which  mathematics  provides  a  tool  for  understanding  and  dealing  with                             various aspects of present-day living, such as managing personal finances, making                             social choices, appreciating geometric designs, understanding codes used in data                             transmission and security, and dividing limited resources fairly. These aspects will                             provide opportunities for actually doing mathematics in a broad range of exercises                             that bring out the various dimensions of mathematics as a way of knowing, and test                             the students' understanding and capacity.

The course deals with the nature, as well as                             the factors and forces that affect the development and maintenance of personal                             identity.  The directive to know Oneself has inspired countless and varied ways to                             comply. Among the questions that everyone has had grapple with one or other is                             “who  am  I?”.  At  no  other  period  is  this  question  asked  more  urgently  than  in                             adolescence  –  traditionally  believed  to  be  a  time  of  vulnerability  and  great                             possibilities.  Issues of self and identity are among the most critical for the young.                             This  course  is  intended  to  facilitate  the  exploration  of  the  issues  and  concerns                             regarding self and identity to arrive at a better understanding of one’s self.  It strives                             to meet the goal by stressing the integration of the personal with the academic –                             contextualizing matters discussed in the classroom and in everyday experiences of                             students – making for better learning, generating a new appreciation for the learning                             process, and developing a more critical and reflective attitude while enabling them                             to manage and improve their selves to attain a better quality of life. This course is                             divided into three major parts: The first part seeks to understand the construct of the                             self from various disciplinal perspectives, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and                             psychology – as well as the more traditional division between the East and West—                             each seeking to provide answers to the difficult but essential question of \"What is                             the self?\" And raising, among others, the question: \"Is there even such a construct                             as the self?\"                             The second part explores some of the various aspects that make up the self, such                             as the biological and material up to and including the more recent Digital Self. The                             third and final part identifies three areas of concern for young students: learning, goal                             setting, and managing stress. It also provides for the more practical application of                             the concepts discussed in this course and enables them the hands-on experience of                             developing self-help plans for self-regulated learning, goal setting, and self-care.

Robles, University President, designated university                program coordinators for the different curricula offered by the university (Office Memorandum No.                PHDR-77-17). The university program coordinators are tasked to oversee, monitor and ensure                 that  the  university  is  implementing  a  uniform  curricular  structure  for  each  curricular  program                offered  in  various  campuses;  and  that  the  programs  are  compliant  with  the  CHED  minimum                standards. They will spearhead the conduct of periodic review and evaluation of the curricular                 programs and proposed revisions or whenever necessary.                        The University BSIT Program Coordinator formed a committee to revise the curriculum                structure  of  the  program,  which  is  composed  of  different  program coordinators  from different                 campuses and selected faculty members of the BSIT program.                                                                                                         1 | P a g e","The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) released the latest CHED Memorandum                Order (CMO No. 25 Series 2015) on the Revised Policies, Standards and Guidelines for the                 Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Information Systems                (BSIS), and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), which was used as the basis                of the curriculum revision for the BSIT program. The revised curriculum structure of the program                 will be subjected for approval of the University Academic Council, Board of Regents and CHED                before its full implementation on the S.Y. 2018-2019.                  Objectives of the Curriculum Revision                         The general objective of the curriculum revision was to design a new curriculum structure                 for the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program based on the CMO No. 25                Series of 2015.                         Specifically, it aimed to:                        1.  compare the proposed curriculum to existing and CHED minimum standards;                        2.  prepare the breakdown of courses of the program; and                         3.  provide the checklist of the courses of the program per year and per semester.                 Strategies Performed on the Curriculum Revision                     •   The curriculum revision committee for BSIT was formed and consisted of the Program                        Coordinators from the main campus and each satellite campus.                    •   The first workshop on curriculum revision was held on August 10, 2017 at CvSU-CCAT                         Computer Laboratory.                    •   Initial draft of the revised BSIT curriculum was presented by the program coordinators to                         their respective campuses, department chairpersons and faculty from August 14 to 23,                        2017.                    •   The second workshop was held on August 24, 2017 on the same venue. Feedbacks from                         the campuses were integrated in the proposed revised curriculum.                    •   The BSIT proposed curriculum was presented in the CEIT Academic Council meeting on                        February 8, 2018 at CvSU-Main Campus. Some recommendations were applied.                     •   A  joint-curriculum  review  of  the  BSCS  and  the  BSIT  programs  was  conducted  last                        February 27, 2018 at CvSU-CCAT Hostel in the presence of external stakeholders.                    •   The outcomes of the review were presented to the Campus Academic Council of CvSU-                         CCAT on March 14, 2018.                                                                                                        2 | P a g e","Summary of Revisions on the BSIT Curriculum                         Table 1 shows the summary of revisions done on the curriculum structure of the Bachelor                 of Science in Information Technology program.

Robles, University President, designated university                program coordinators for the different curricula offered by the university (Office Memorandum No.                PHDR-77-17). The university program coordinators are tasked to oversee, monitor and ensure                 that  the  university  is  implementing  a  uniform  curricular  structure  for  each  curricular  program                offered  in  various  campuses;  and  that  the  programs  are  compliant  with  the  CHED  minimum                standards. They will spearhead the conduct of periodic review and evaluation of the curricular                 programs and proposed revisions or whenever necessary.                        The University BSIT Program Coordinator formed a committee to revise the curriculum                structure  of  the  program,  which  is  composed  of  different  program coordinators  from different                 campuses and selected faculty members of the BSIT program.                                                                                                         1 | P a g e","The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) released the latest CHED Memorandum                Order (CMO No. 25 Series 2015) on the Revised Policies, Standards and Guidelines for the                 Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Information Systems                (BSIS), and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), which was used as the basis                of the curriculum revision for the BSIT program. The revised curriculum structure of the program                 will be subjected for approval of the University Academic Council, Board of Regents and CHED                before its full implementation on the S.Y. 2018-2019.                  Objectives of the Curriculum Revision                         The general objective of the curriculum revision was to design a new curriculum structure                 for the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program based on the CMO No. 25                Series of 2015.                         Specifically, it aimed to:                        1.  compare the proposed curriculum to existing and CHED minimum standards;                        2.  prepare the breakdown of courses of the program; and                         3.  provide the checklist of the courses of the program per year and per semester.                 Strategies Performed on the Curriculum Revision                     •   The curriculum revision committee for BSIT was formed and consisted of the Program                        Coordinators from the main campus and each satellite campus.                    •   The first workshop on curriculum revision was held on August 10, 2017 at CvSU-CCAT                         Computer Laboratory.                    •   Initial draft of the revised BSIT curriculum was presented by the program coordinators to                         their respective campuses, department chairpersons and faculty from August 14 to 23,                        2017.                    •   The second workshop was held on August 24, 2017 on the same venue. Feedbacks from                         the campuses were integrated in the proposed revised curriculum.                    •   The BSIT proposed curriculum was presented in the CEIT Academic Council meeting on                        February 8, 2018 at CvSU-Main Campus. Some recommendations were applied.                     •   A  joint-curriculum  review  of  the  BSCS  and  the  BSIT  programs  was  conducted  last                        February 27, 2018 at CvSU-CCAT Hostel in the presence of external stakeholders.                    •   The outcomes of the review were presented to the Campus Academic Council of CvSU-                         CCAT on March 14, 2018.                                                                                                        2 | P a g e","Summary of Revisions on the BSIT Curriculum                         Table 1 shows the summary of revisions done on the curriculum structure of the Bachelor                 of Science in Information Technology program.

Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Technology                              GNED 03 - Mathematics in the Modern World. This course deals with nature of                             mathematics, appreciation of its practical, intellectual, and aesthetic dimensions, and                             application of mathematical tools in daily life The course begins with an introduction                             to  the  nature  of  mathematics  as  an  exploration  of  patterns  (in  nature  and  the                             environment)  and  as  an  application  of  inductive  and  deductive  reasoning.  By                             exploring  these  topics,  students  are  encouraged  to  go  beyond  the  typical                             understanding  of  mathematics  as  merely  a  set  of  formulas  but  as  a  source  of                             aesthetics in patterns of nature, for example, and a rich language in itself (and of                             science) governed by logic and reasoning.    The course then proceeds to survey                             ways  in  which  mathematics  provides  a  tool  for  understanding  and  dealing  with                             various aspects of present-day living, such as managing personal finances, making                             social choices, appreciating geometric designs, understanding codes used in data                             transmission and security, and dividing limited resources fairly. These aspects will                             provide opportunities for actually doing mathematics in a broad range of exercises                             that bring out the various dimensions of mathematics as a way of knowing, and test                             the students' understanding and capacity.

This                             interdisciplinary course engages students to confront the realities brought about by                             science and technology in society.  Such realities pervade the personal, the public                             and  the  global  aspects  of  our  living  and  are  integral  to  human  development.                             Scientific knowledge and technological development happen in the context of society                             with all its socio-political, cultural, economic and philosophical underpinnings at play.                             This course seeks to instill reflective knowledge in the students that they are able to                             live the good life and display ethical decision making in the face of scientific and                             technological  advancement.

The course deals with the nature, as well as                             the factors and forces that affect the development and maintenance of personal                             identity.  The directive to know Oneself has inspired countless and varied ways to                             comply. Among the questions that everyone has had grapple with one or other is                             “who  am  I?”.  At  no  other  period  is  this  question  asked  more  urgently  than  in                             adolescence  –  traditionally  believed  to  be  a  time  of  vulnerability  and  great                             possibilities.  Issues of self and identity are among the most critical for the young.                             This  course  is  intended  to  facilitate  the  exploration  of  the  issues  and  concerns                             regarding self and identity to arrive at a better understanding of one’s self.  It strives                             to meet the goal by stressing the integration of the personal with the academic –                             contextualizing matters discussed in the classroom and in everyday experiences of                             students – making for better learning, generating a new appreciation for the learning                             process, and developing a more critical and reflective attitude while enabling them                             to manage and improve their selves to attain a better quality of life. This course is                             divided into three major parts: The first part seeks to understand the construct of the                             self from various disciplinal perspectives, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and                             psychology – as well as the more traditional division between the East and West—                             each seeking to provide answers to the difficult but essential question of \"What is                             the self?\" And raising, among others, the question: \"Is there even such a construct                             as the self?\"                             The second part explores some of the various aspects that make up the self, such                             as the biological and material up to and including the more recent Digital Self. The                             third and final part identifies three areas of concern for young students: learning, goal                             setting, and managing stress. It also provides for the more practical application of                             the concepts discussed in this course and enables them the hands-on experience of                             developing self-help plans for self-regulated learning, goal setting, and self-care.

The first part of the discussion revolved around the accomplishments and problems met                by each campus.                        Notable  accomplishments  include  submission  of  the  program  to  both  RQUAT  and                AACCUP Accreditation.","Meanwhile, the general problems faced by most campus include:                          OJT number of hours                          Submission of narrative reports to English Critiquing                          Format of Undergraduate Thesis Documents                          Evaluation tool for Capstone Projects                          Classification of DCIT, ITEC, COSC subjects.                          Field expertise of the produced graduates.                         At exactly 1:15 pm the body re-convened at the CCL3.                         Prof.  Christopher  G.  Estonilo  presided  the  meeting.  He  discussed  the  contents  of                Commission  on  Higher  Education  Memorandum  Order  25  s2015.  It  includes  the  following                topics:                          Distinguishing BSIT from BSCS curriculum.                          Course Specifications                          Program Curricula                         Prof. Richard Hernandez, during the discussion of course curricula, suggested that the                body should have its own set of courseware. In response, Prof. Christopher G. Estonilo said that                if  the  body  wants  a  unified  course  outline,  there  should  be  a  course  champion  to  check  the                contents of the course outlines. On the other hand, Prof Jeffrey Papa, reiterated the importance                of Academic Freedom in designing the teaching methods.                         Also,  Prof.  Jeffrey  Papa  stressed  to  the  body  the  presence  of  Provisions  for  K-12                Implementation  in  the  CMO.  This  section  stressed  that  the  18  units  removed  from  the  GE                subjects be replaced by professional/domain courses.                         In conjunction with this, Prof. Christopher Estonilo provided the group with copies of the                approved general subjects to be offered by the College of Arts and Sciences.                         It was followed by the presentation of the breakdown of courses showing the decrease                of units included in the new curriculum as it is already in accordance to the prescribed number                of units stated in the CMO.                         During the deliberation of the new curriculum, the following were put into action:                         1.  People  and  Earth’s  Ecosystem  was  moved  from  Language  and  Humanities  to                           Mathematics. It replaced Environmental Science.                        2.  The body moved to replace Entrepreneurial Mind with Gender and Society.                        3.  The  body  voted  to  include  Philippine  Indigenous  Communities  in  the  general                           education subjects to be taken by the students. (15-2-1).                        4.  Discrete Structures was changed to Discrete Mathematics. This is in accordance to                           the subject title stated in the CMO 25 s. 2015.                        5.  The body was able to note that there is a subject (Probability and Statistics) which                           fell under the Additional Mathematics Subject prescribed by the CMO.                         Furthermore, the following were suggested:","rd                                                                                                            nd                        1.  Prof. Allen C. Muyot suggested that the practicum of BSIT be moved to 3  Year 2                           Semester to allow students to gain additional knowledge in their field.                         2.  Prof.  Richard  Hernandez  suggested  that  practicum  be  retained  in  the  4   Year  2                                                                                                    th                                                                                                            nd                           Semester  to avoid  student drop-outs.  Particularly  those  who do not back  because                           they have already been absorbed by their practicum employers.                                                                                                        rd                        3.  The body suggested that Undergraduate Thesis 1 be removed from the  3  Year,                           Mid-Year because of the following:                            a.  It would be hard to accommodate all the title defense of the thesis groups.                           b.  It would be hard for the students to formulate thesis titles in merely two months.                           c.  There is a possibility that thesis advisers or technical critics be on leave during                               the Mid-Year.                         4.  Mr. Aries Gelera asked the body to add a subject in the new curriculum which would                           deal with hardware.                         5.  Prof. Jeffrey Papa suggested converting the 18 professional subjects to course-core                           subjects. This is to allow the BSIT curriculum to produce graduates with mastery in                           specific fields.                         The next meeting was agreed to be set on August 24, 2017.                         The afternoon session ended at exactly 4:00 pm.                  Prepared by:                  YVANA JARDINE R.

Robles, University President, designated university                program coordinators for the different curricula offered by the university (Office Memorandum No.                PHDR-77-17). The university program coordinators are tasked to oversee, monitor and ensure                 that  the  university  is  implementing  a  uniform  curricular  structure  for  each  curricular  program                offered  in  various  campuses;  and  that  the  programs  are  compliant  with  the  CHED  minimum                standards. They will spearhead the conduct of periodic review and evaluation of the curricular                 programs and proposed revisions or whenever necessary.                        The University BSIT Program Coordinator formed a committee to revise the curriculum                structure  of  the  program,  which  is  composed  of  different  program coordinators  from different                 campuses and selected faculty members of the BSIT program.                                                                                                         1 | P a g e","The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) released the latest CHED Memorandum                Order (CMO No. 25 Series 2015) on the Revised Policies, Standards and Guidelines for the                 Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Information Systems                (BSIS), and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), which was used as the basis                of the curriculum revision for the BSIT program. The revised curriculum structure of the program                 will be subjected for approval of the University Academic Council, Board of Regents and CHED                before its full implementation on the S.Y. 2018-2019.                  Objectives of the Curriculum Revision                         The general objective of the curriculum revision was to design a new curriculum structure                 for the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program based on the CMO No. 25                Series of 2015.                         Specifically, it aimed to:                        1.  compare the proposed curriculum to existing and CHED minimum standards;                        2.  prepare the breakdown of courses of the program; and                         3.  provide the checklist of the courses of the program per year and per semester.                 Strategies Performed on the Curriculum Revision                     •   The curriculum revision committee for BSIT was formed and consisted of the Program                        Coordinators from the main campus and each satellite campus.                    •   The first workshop on curriculum revision was held on August 10, 2017 at CvSU-CCAT                         Computer Laboratory.                    •   Initial draft of the revised BSIT curriculum was presented by the program coordinators to                         their respective campuses, department chairpersons and faculty from August 14 to 23,                        2017.                    •   The second workshop was held on August 24, 2017 on the same venue. Feedbacks from                         the campuses were integrated in the proposed revised curriculum.                    •   The BSIT proposed curriculum was presented in the CEIT Academic Council meeting on                        February 8, 2018 at CvSU-Main Campus. Some recommendations were applied.                     •   A  joint-curriculum  review  of  the  BSCS  and  the  BSIT  programs  was  conducted  last                        February 27, 2018 at CvSU-CCAT Hostel in the presence of external stakeholders.                    •   The outcomes of the review were presented to the Campus Academic Council of CvSU-                         CCAT on March 14, 2018.                                                                                                        2 | P a g e","Summary of Revisions on the BSIT Curriculum                         Table 1 shows the summary of revisions done on the curriculum structure of the Bachelor                 of Science in Information Technology program.

Art appreciation is a three-unit course that develops                             students’  ability  to  appreciate,  analyze,  and  critique  works  of  arts.  Through                             interdisciplinary and multimodal approaches, this course equips students with broad                             knowledge of the practical, historical, philosophical, and social relevance of the arts                             in order to hone students’ ability to articulate their understanding of the arts. The                             course also develops students’ competency in researching and curating art as well                             as conceptualizing, mounting and evaluating art productions.  The course aims to                             develop  students’  genuine  appreciation  for  Philippine  arts  by  providing  the,                             opportunities to explore the diversity and richness and their rootedness in Filipino                             culture.

Ethics deals with principles of ethical behavior in modern society                             at the level of the person, society and in interaction with the environment and other                             shared resources (CMO 20 s 2013). Morality pertains to the standards of right and                             wrong  that  an  individual  originally  picks  up  from  the  community.    The  course                             discusses the context and principles of ethical behavior in modern society at the level                             of  individual,  society  and  interaction  with  the  environment  and  other  shared                             resources.  The course also teaches students to make moral decisions by using                             dominant moral frameworks and by applying a seven-step moral reasoning model to                             analyze and solve moral dilemmas. The course is organized according to the three                             (3)  main  elements  of  the  moral  experience  (a)  agent,  including  context-cultural,                             communal, and environmental; (b) the act; and (c) reason or framework (for the act).

By                             exploring  these  topics,  students  are  encouraged  to  go  beyond  the  typical                             understanding  of  mathematics  as  merely  a  set  of  formulas  but  as  a  source  of                             aesthetics in patterns of nature, for example, and a rich language in itself (and of                             science) governed by logic and reasoning.    The course then proceeds to survey                             ways  in  which  mathematics  provides  a  tool  for  understanding  and  dealing  with                             various aspects of present-day living, such as managing personal finances, making                             social choices, appreciating geometric designs, understanding codes used in data                             transmission and security, and dividing limited resources fairly. These aspects will                             provide opportunities for actually doing mathematics in a broad range of exercises                             that bring out the various dimensions of mathematics as a way of knowing, and test                             the students' understanding and capacity.

The course deals with the nature, as well as                             the factors and forces that affect the development and maintenance of personal                             identity.  The directive to know Oneself has inspired countless and varied ways to                             comply. Among the questions that everyone has had grapple with one or other is                             “who  am  I?”.  At  no  other  period  is  this  question  asked  more  urgently  than  in                             adolescence  –  traditionally  believed  to  be  a  time  of  vulnerability  and  great                             possibilities.  Issues of self and identity are among the most critical for the young.                             This  course  is  intended  to  facilitate  the  exploration  of  the  issues  and  concerns                             regarding self and identity to arrive at a better understanding of one’s self.  It strives                             to meet the goal by stressing the integration of the personal with the academic –                             contextualizing matters discussed in the classroom and in everyday experiences of                             students – making for better learning, generating a new appreciation for the learning                             process, and developing a more critical and reflective attitude while enabling them                             to manage and improve their selves to attain a better quality of life. This course is                             divided into three major parts: The first part seeks to understand the construct of the                             self from various disciplinal perspectives, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and                             psychology – as well as the more traditional division between the East and West—                             each seeking to provide answers to the difficult but essential question of \"What is                             the self?\" And raising, among others, the question: \"Is there even such a construct                             as the self?\"                             The second part explores some of the various aspects that make up the self, such                             as the biological and material up to and including the more recent Digital Self. The                             third and final part identifies three areas of concern for young students: learning, goal                             setting, and managing stress. It also provides for the more practical application of                             the concepts discussed in this course and enables them the hands-on experience of                             developing self-help plans for self-regulated learning, goal setting, and self-care.
