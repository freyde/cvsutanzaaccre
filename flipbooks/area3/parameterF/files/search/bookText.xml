                                                  Special class- below         --  ten (10) students;


                                 Should  the  class  size  fall  below  the  minimum  number,  the
                              Department  Head  should  be  informed  immediately  to  decide
                              whether  to  dissolve  the  class  or  to  maintain  it  as  a  special  class
                              approved by the Dean of the College. Should the class be dissolved,
                              faculty  members  should  advise  the  student  to  transfer  to  other
                              classes.
                          d)    First  Day  of  Classes.  During  the  first  day  of  classes,  faculty
                              members should sign the registration forms of their students and
                              collect their class cards or registration forms. The class cards serve
                              as evidence that the students are officially enrolled in the class.
                                         A  student  is  considered  officially  enrolled  only  after  the
                                         following steps are satisfied:
                                       University Registrar has duly certified the enrollment on
                                         the registration cards.

                                         University Cashier has stamped on the required forms an
                                         acknowledgement of payment of fees, and

                                       Professors/instructors  have  placed  their  initials  or
                                         signatures on the registration cards.
                                     The  class  list,  issued  by  the  Office  of  the  University
                              Registrar, provides the name of the students, regular or irregular,
                              officially  enrolled  in  a  course.  Faculty  members  should  get  their
                              class lists from their Department Head on the first day of classes.
                                         Moreover,  faculty  members  should  orient  the  students
                              about the objectives, contents and requirements of the course, and
                              explain  the  bases  for  evaluating  students’  performance.  It  is
                              recommended  that  the  students  be  provided  with  a  copy  of  the
                              course syllabus.

                          e)  Class Meetings and Dismissal of Classes. Punctuality should  be
                              observed at all times in the conduct of classes. If the class should
                              start at 7 a.m., the faculty should be in the classroom at exactly

                               7 a.m. Classes should be dismissed at least five (5) minutes before
                              the end of each period to allow students to move and transfer to
                              their next class.

                          f) Make-Up Classes. Faculty members who miss their classes due to
                              official  functions  should  conduct  make-up  activities/classes.
                              Make-up  activities/classes  should  be  for  both  extra  and  regular
                              teaching  assignments.  Request  forms  for  make-up  classes  are
                              available at the Dean’s Office.

                                                                                                           88

               I.  TITLE:     TANZA  CAMPUS  FACULTY,  STAFF  AND  STUDENTS’  VIRTUAL
                              RECOGNITION PROGRAM

               II.  RATIONALE:

                          Recognition of one’s efforts is more highly valued than money. The importance of
                   offering awards and incentives that recognize, validate and value outstanding work and
                   accomplishments made  by  faculty  and  staff,  and  students  keeps  them motivated  and
                   provides  effective  methods  for  reinforcing  the  campus  goals  and  objectives.    Any
                   individual who is recognized for simply doing his/her best may have gained an increased
                   level  of  self-confidence,  a  sense  of  accomplishment  and  respect  among  his/her  peer
                   group. Such a feeling of accomplishment may carry forward throughout their lives and
                   ultimately improve his/her well-being.

                          During these trying times, when pandemic has brought about a huge change in
                   the  morale  and  self-esteem  of  the  faculty,  staff  and  students,  it  is  high  time  that  the
                   administration of Cavite State University – Tanza Campus acknowledges and recognizes
                   their outstanding achievements and invaluable contributions to the campus in particular
                   and to the university in general.  Hence, Cavite State University – Tanza Campus would
                   like to conduct its Faculty, Staff and Students’ Virtual Recognition Program for AY 2019 –
                   2020  with  the  theme  “Trailblazing  in  the  New  Normal:  Campus  Empowerment
                   through Peer Recognitions and Awards”.  This will be livestreamed at Cavite State
                   University – Tanza Campus Official Facebook Page on 19 October 2020 at 1:00 pm.

               III.  OBJECTIVES:
                   This activity aims to:

                     recognize  the  outstanding  accomplishments  of  the  faculty  in  their  instruction,
                       research, and extension activities;
                     validate  and  value  outstanding  work  and  accomplishments  and  invaluable
                       contributions of the staff to the campus;
                     honor and credit exemplary achievements of students in academic and non-academic
                       activities they engaged in; and
                     provide a sense of accomplishment and pay respect among faculty, staff and students
                       among his/her peer group.

               IV. PARTICIPANTS

               faculty members and staff with gratitude as he witnessed the untiring support and
               whole-hearted dedication of faculty and staff to continue the semester despite the

               current situation of the academic community.
                       Furthermore,  the  old  and  new  faculty  members  were  introduced  by  their

               respective department chairpersons. Each department chairpersons provided a brief

               Mr. Luke Ty about netiquettes in handling online classes.

               Cajigas, Tanza Campus Coordinator, who said that as the University embraced the

                                  Venue: International House II, CvSU-Main Campus


                       The  T3  Teachers’  Capability  Enhancement  Seminar-Workshop  is  an  academic
               capability training enhancement usually conducted on a yearly basis in the campus which
               primary goal is to enhance T3 faculty members’ teaching capabilities. This is usually held prior
               to the opening of classes. The highlights of the activity this year were on mental health and
               orientation on academic and administrative policies which was held last July 30, 2019 at the
               Cavite State University – Main Campus, International House 1.

               I.    Morning Session
                            The morning program officially started at 9am with an opening prayer and the

                         T3 Faculty Capability Building Seminar for Research Documentation
                            March 28-29, 2019, International House 1, CvSU-Main Campus


               Organizers:  T3  Tanza,  Trece  Martires  City,  and  General  Trias  City  Campuses Research
               Unit, T3 Faculty and University Research Center

               Participants: T3 Permanent, Temporary, Contractual, and selected J.O. Faculty Members

               Rationale:  The  T3  Campuses  have  envisioned  to  establish  a  culture  where  faculty  and
               students  shall  engage  in  research.  Hence,  the  faculty  members,  especially  those  with
               plantilla  positions  and  in  professional  rank,  are  encouraged  to  produce  an  approved  and
               funded  research  in  line  with  the  University’s  Research  Thrust.  Each  faculty  member
               recognizes the importance of this endeavor as part of their core functions as academician.
               However, the number of funded research is still very low at present for the three campuses
               maybe because there is a need for knowledge enhancement of the protocols in writing a
               research proposal and that makes this activity relevant. This capacity building activity would
               serve  as a  stepping  stone  for  the  faculty  members  to be  able  to  write  a  quality  research
               work. The activity further aims to increase the number of funded researches in the campus
               as well as the number of research publications.

               Objectives: This faculty research writing seminar-workshop aims to:
               1.  Delineate the standards and concepts in writing a research proposal with possibility for
                   funding by the University or through external funding sources; and
               2.  Apply the concepts learned to produce quality and relevant research proposal at the end
                   of the seminar.

               General  Trias  City,  and  Tanza  Campuses)  attended  the  seminar  entitled,  “T3  Faculty

               Indang,  Cavite  from  8:00  a.m.  to  5:00  p.m.,  with  Ms.  Leslie  Anne  N.  Gatdula,  CvSU-
               General Trias City Instructor, as in-charge of the ceremonies.

               Prof.  Noel  A.  Sedigo,  T3  Campus  Administrator,  gave  the  welcome  message,  which
               emphasized  the  importance  of  research  in  teaching,  saying  that  most  educators  are
               accustomed  to  using  materials  culled  from  other  countries  when  one  of  the  major
               components of life in the academe is innovation through research. He said that this was how
               teachers should be teaching their corresponding subject matters. He also mentioned that it
               took years for him to finally find his own niche in his field.

               importance of research to the University and its faculty members. She emphasized how hard
               work plays an important role in one’s commitment to research and that workload should not
               be a hindrance. She further mentioned that by the year 2025, innovation would be the main
               focus of the University. The importance of research was personal satisfaction, points in the
               NBC  evaluation,  additional  income,  networking  and  collaboration,  and  travel.  She
               encouraged interdisciplinary research. She also tackled the different thematic areas of the
               research and extension agenda of CvSU: agri-fisheries and food security, biodiversity and
               environmental  conservation,  smart  engineering,  ICT  and  industrial  competitiveness,  public
               health and welfare, and societal development and equality. She also talked about the official
               research  proposal  format  of  the  university,  which  consists  of  the  following:  overview,
               problem, importance, literature, objectives, and time and place. Finally, she tackled how to
               write  quality  research  proposals  for  possible  funding,  as  well  as  crafting  a  convincing
               introduction that includes the rationale and objectives. She credited Dr. Bautista’s book on
               technical writing for the contents of her lecture on the principles of writing a good research
               proposal and concluded her talk by emphasizing that researchers need to cherish their work
               and that there was no actual recipe for success but just “simple rules, dedication, and hard
               work.”

               For  the  second  speaker,  Dr.  Isaias  A.  Banaag,  Faculty  Researcher  of  the  College  of
               Education  (CED)  gave  his  talk  on  how  to  create  a  viable  theoretical  and  conceptual
               framework  for  research.  He  talked  about  the  common  error  regarding  the  Input-Process-
               Output (IPO), which was in fact, a model or framework and not a method. He further said
               that the framework was actually different from the research paradigm, a source of difficulty in
               most research papers. The problem, he said, was actually rooted in problem building, the
               problem being the driving force behind a research, which should be geared to address gaps
               between  what  was  happening  and  what  should  be  happening.  Structure  or  maps  were
               needed in order to come up with broad areas to be covered in the research. This would help
               the researcher to emerge from chaotic thinking and into a more logical, organized viewpoint
               for the research problem at hand. He also explained the difference between a theoretical
               framework and a conceptual framework: a theoretical framework is used when there is only
               one  theory  featured  in  a  basic  research,  whereas  a  conceptual  framework  is  used  when
               there are multiple theories and other personal observations that need to be synthesized in a
               more  complex  type  of  research.  He  also  distinguished  a  construct  from  a  variable—the
               construct being a concept with a deliberate and invented meaning, while a variable being a
               construct with an assigned numerical value. He ended his discussion by summarizing the
               differences  between  a  theoretical  framework  and  a  conceptual  framework:  a  theoretical
               framework is “adopted from a pre-existing theory or theoretical perspective, an application of
               a  theory  as  a  whole  or  in  part,  and  with  a  literature  research  that  is  deductive”  while  a
               conceptual framework is “created from a variety of conceptual and theoretical perspective, a
               synthesis of relevant concepts, and with research literature that is usually inductive.”
























                                    Dr. Isaias A. Banaag discusses the importance of
                                    problem-building in research.

               and Sciences, discussed how to write the review of related literature and the methodology
               portion of a research proposal. He talked about the most common sources available for use
               in a researcher’s review of related literature. He emphasized the importance of reading and
               mobility, spending time going over various references and going to different places in order
               to  find  relevant  material  for  one’s  research.  He  said  that  the  best  materials  were  those
               articles published within the last five years, on a case-to-case basis, depending on the field.
               Non-referred (i.e., not peer-reviewed) journals, newsletters, and magazines were considered
               unreliable sources of literature. He stated the most common problem in research was the
               lack  of  available  literature. When  literature  as  limited,  he  said,  a  researcher may  conduct
               field work or interviews to determine whether the topic was worth pursuing; if not, then the
               researcher should consider changing the topic. He also highlighted several key points such
               as always thinking of what one’s research will contribute to the field and avoiding duplication
               in order “locate one’s research within the context of existing literature.” He further said that a
               literature review could be arranged either chronologically or thematically, and that citation
               provide evidence of the researcher’s interpretation of the sources gathered. Being selective
               was very important, in that the researcher must choose only the most important points to be
               included  in  the  review.  One  must  also  exercise  caution  when  paraphrasing  to  avoid
               plagiarism.  It  was  also  important  to  keep  one’s  “voice”  and  restrain  oneself  from  being  a
               collection of different authors’ voices despite the fact that review must definitely include the
               “big  names”  or  experts  on  the  field.  The  review  must  be  punctuated  with  one’s  own
               perspective and interpretation of the new knowledge presented. He also discussed common
               mistakes such as not relating clearly to the research problem, not taking sufficient time to
               identify the most relevant sources to use, not relying on primary research studies, and only
               including sources that validate one’s assumptions rather than those that refute them.

               For the fourth speaker, Dr. Agnes C. Francisco, another faculty researcher of the College
               of Arts and Sciences, talked about methods and methodology in the field of social sciences.
               She  first  distinguished  a  “method,”  a  technical  step  taken  to  do  research,  from  the
               “methodology,” a discussion of the underlying reason why particular methods will be used.
               She said that the methodology portion of the research will answer questions on how the data
               will be collected or generated and then analyzed, and clearly articulates the reasons why a
               researcher  has  chosen  a  particular  procedure  or  technique.  She  further  stated  that  this
               section specifically features how the data gathered must be treated in order to achieve the
               objectives of the research. It also discusses problems that are anticipated and how they can
               be minimized through the chosen methods. For her, this was very important because the
               method  a  researcher  chooses  affects  the  results;  thus,  “an  unreliable  method  produces
               unreliable results.” A faulty methodology brings about a “domino effect,” affecting all other
               aspects  of  the  research  and  lessening  the  value  of  one’s  findings.  She  mentioned  the
               important sections of the methodology section: the research design (whether quantitative or
               qualitative, including the specific type or types to be used), the sampling technique (how the
               data  will  be  collected  and  what  safeguard  techniques  will  be  used),  the
               respondents/participants  or  source/corpus  for  those  studies  involving  discourse  (who  will
               participate  and  how  many)  the  research  instrument,  the  unit  of  analysis  (for  coding  in

                                                                                             V01-2018-07-17]]></page><page Index="395"><![CDATA[discourse), the data gathering procedure, and the data analysis portion. She emphasized the
               importance  of  anonymity  in  this  section,  especially  for  respondents  who  have  been
               interviewed,  and  other  agencies  involved  in  the  data-gathering  portion.  She  further
               recommended that 30% of the existing population was enough for a qualitative research and
               8-10 respondents for a qualitative one in order to ensure that the chosen sample was a good
               representative of the population, with the inclusion of corresponding profiles and justification
               for being selected. She reminded everyone about the importance of pre-testing for self-made
               instruments and to make sure that the tool specifically addressed the objectives and problem
               of  the  research.  Other  reminders  were  regarding  the  use  of  free-prior  informed  consent
               (FPIC)  or  waivers  for  sensitive  topics  with  ethical  issues  involved  and  avoiding  the
               unnecessary inclusion of definitions. Overall, she recommended the following components of
               an effectively written methodology section:  an clear methodological approach, a justification
               for how the chosen approach fits the research design, the specific methods to be used, the
               manner  in  which  the  data  will  be  analyzed,  a  solid  rationale  for  the  methodologies  to  be
               used,  a  well-supported  reason  for  the  choice  of  respondents,  and  a  comprehensive  yet
               concise scope and limitations section.

               For  the  fourth  speaker,  Dr.  Agnes  B.  Alimboyuguen,  another  faculty  researcher  of  the
               College of Arts and Sciences, talked about methods and methodology in the field of natural
               sciences. For this area, it describes the activities necessary for the completion of a project,
               mainly because it provides information that allows the reader to validate the results and the
               conclusion. She said that some key requirements of a good natural science research were
               the following: understandable and repeatable, conforms to objectives, and confined to the
               procedures and methods. She said that there were specific details to be included such as
               the manufacturer or model of the specialized equipment to be used, the sample to be used,
               time  and  place,  replications,  and  conditions  of  the  experiment,  data  analysis,  statistical
               analysis.  She  concluded  her  talk  by  emphasizing  that  research  impact,  academic
               consequences, and societal consequences were three major considerations in research in
               the natural sciences. The value of one’s research in terms of its long-term benefits was what
               counts. The beneficiaries should be the students, faculty and staff, farmers, government and
               private  institutions,  industry  and  other  clientele  outside  the  CvSU  community.  Publishable
               and patentable work was what they were looking for in this field. Impact assessment was no
               longer  the  measure  of  success  in  research  but  whether  there  was  a  policy  that  was
               developed out of the research. She encouraged everyone to copyright their works. Towards
               the end of her discussion, it was established, through the moderatorship of Prof. Sedigo, that
               the  T3  Campuses  will  focus  on  these  specific  programs:  Information  and  Computer
               Technology  (ICT),  Education,  Business  Management  (Entrepreneurship),  Hospitality
               Management (Product Development).

                                    requirements of a good natural science research.

               Further discussions on the following topics ensued throughout the faculty capability-building
               seminar:  the  budgetary  requirements  and  work  plan,  the  major  activities  and  expected
               output, and the potential impact and target beneficiaries of the given research.

               Ms. Roncesvalle J. Caipang, T3 Research Coordinator who spearheaded and organized
               the  capability  building  seminar,  gave  her  closing  remarks  by  thanking  everyone  for  their
               attendance and for a very productive day. Afterwards, Prof. Sedigo announced that on April
               1-2, he will be evaluating all proposals before endorsing them to the Research Center on
               April 3, 2019, not later than 6:00 p.m. All research titles were then submitted by the faculty
               members who no doubt became inspired and motivated at the end of the two-day capability-
               building seminar.

               I.  TITLE:     TANZA  CAMPUS  FACULTY,  STAFF  AND  STUDENTS’  VIRTUAL
                              RECOGNITION PROGRAM

               II.  RATIONALE:

                          Recognition of one’s efforts is more highly valued than money. The importance of
                   offering awards and incentives that recognize, validate and value outstanding work and
                   accomplishments made  by  faculty  and  staff,  and  students  keeps  them motivated  and
                   provides  effective  methods  for  reinforcing  the  campus  goals  and  objectives.    Any
                   individual who is recognized for simply doing his/her best may have gained an increased
                   level  of  self-confidence,  a  sense  of  accomplishment  and  respect  among  his/her  peer
                   group. Such a feeling of accomplishment may carry forward throughout their lives and
                   ultimately improve his/her well-being.

                          During these trying times, when pandemic has brought about a huge change in
                   the  morale  and  self-esteem  of  the  faculty,  staff  and  students,  it  is  high  time  that  the
                   administration of Cavite State University – Tanza Campus acknowledges and recognizes
                   their outstanding achievements and invaluable contributions to the campus in particular
                   and to the university in general.  Hence, Cavite State University – Tanza Campus would
                   like to conduct its Faculty, Staff and Students’ Virtual Recognition Program for AY 2019 –
                   2020  with  the  theme  “Trailblazing  in  the  New  Normal:  Campus  Empowerment
                   through Peer Recognitions and Awards”.  This will be livestreamed at Cavite State
                   University – Tanza Campus Official Facebook Page on 19 October 2020 at 1:00 pm.

               III.  OBJECTIVES:
                   This activity aims to:

                     recognize  the  outstanding  accomplishments  of  the  faculty  in  their  instruction,
                       research, and extension activities;
                     validate  and  value  outstanding  work  and  accomplishments  and  invaluable
                       contributions of the staff to the campus;
                     honor and credit exemplary achievements of students in academic and non-academic
                       activities they engaged in; and
                     provide a sense of accomplishment and pay respect among faculty, staff and students
                       among his/her peer group.

               IV. PARTICIPANTS
                          Participants would be the campus dean, key officials, all faculty, employees and
                   students of the Cavite State University – Tanza Campus.

               V.  BUDGETARY ALLOCATION
                          Since  this  will  be  a  virtual  recognition  program,  no  budgetary  requirements  is

               I.  TITLE:     TANZA  CAMPUS  FACULTY,  STAFF  AND  STUDENTS’  VIRTUAL
                              RECOGNITION PROGRAM

               II.  RATIONALE:

                          Recognition of one’s efforts is more highly valued than money. The importance of
                   offering awards and incentives that recognize, validate and value outstanding work and
                   accomplishments made  by  faculty  and  staff,  and  students  keeps  them motivated  and
                   provides  effective  methods  for  reinforcing  the  campus  goals  and  objectives.    Any
                   individual who is recognized for simply doing his/her best may have gained an increased
                   level  of  self-confidence,  a  sense  of  accomplishment  and  respect  among  his/her  peer
                   group. Such a feeling of accomplishment may carry forward throughout their lives and
                   ultimately improve his/her well-being.

                          During these trying times, when pandemic has brought about a huge change in
                   the  morale  and  self-esteem  of  the  faculty,  staff  and  students,  it  is  high  time  that  the
                   administration of Cavite State University – Tanza Campus acknowledges and recognizes
                   their outstanding achievements and invaluable contributions to the campus in particular
                   and to the university in general.  Hence, Cavite State University – Tanza Campus would
                   like to conduct its Faculty, Staff and Students’ Virtual Recognition Program for AY 2019 –
                   2020  with  the  theme  “Trailblazing  in  the  New  Normal:  Campus  Empowerment
                   through Peer Recognitions and Awards”.  This will be livestreamed at Cavite State
                   University – Tanza Campus Official Facebook Page on 19 October 2020 at 1:00 pm.

               III.  OBJECTIVES:
                   This activity aims to:

                     recognize  the  outstanding  accomplishments  of  the  faculty  in  their  instruction,
                       research, and extension activities;
                     validate  and  value  outstanding  work  and  accomplishments  and  invaluable
                       contributions of the staff to the campus;
                     honor and credit exemplary achievements of students in academic and non-academic
                       activities they engaged in; and
                     provide a sense of accomplishment and pay respect among faculty, staff and students
                       among his/her peer group.

               IV. PARTICIPANTS
                          Participants would be the campus dean, key officials, all faculty, employees and
                   students of the Cavite State University – Tanza Campus.

               V.  BUDGETARY ALLOCATION
                          Since  this  will  be  a  virtual  recognition  program,  no  budgetary  requirements  is
